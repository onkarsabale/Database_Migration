# DESCRIPTION OF TASK

**Task Description**:

1) What is Database Migration
     - Database migration is the process of moving data from one database system to another. It typically involves transferring the schema, data, and sometimes application logic (like stored procedures, triggers, etc.) from a source database to a target database.
     - Types :
             1) Homogeneous	:- Source and target DBs are the same (e.g., MySQL → MySQL).
             2) Heterogeneous	:- Different DBs (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL). Requires conversion.
       
2) Common Reasons for Database Migration:
     - Upgrading to a better system (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL).
     - Cost reduction (moving from paid to open-source DB).
     - Cloud migration (e.g., on-premise to AWS RDS or Azure).
     - Consolidating databases (merging multiple into one).
     - Improving scalability, performance, or security.
  
3) Tools for Database Migration:
     - pgloader (MySQL → PostgreSQL)
     - AWS DMS (cloud migrations)
     - Oracle SQL Developer (Oracle → other DBs)
       
4) What is Data Integrity?
    - Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database or system over its entire lifecycle.
    - Maintaining data integrity ensures that the data is trustworthy and correct, especially during Data entry, Database migration, Storage.
  
5) Types of Data Integrity:
     1) Entity Integrity	:- Ensures each row in a table is unique and identifiable (e.g., primary keys).
     2) Referential Integrity	:- Maintains relationships between tables (e.g., foreign key constraints).
     3) Domain Integrity	:- Ensures data values are valid (e.g., correct data types, constraints like NOT NULL, CHECK).
     4) User-Defined Integrity	:- Business rules enforced by developers (e.g., salary can't be negative).
